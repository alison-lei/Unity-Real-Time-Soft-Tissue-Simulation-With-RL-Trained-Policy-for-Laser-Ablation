# Unity-Real-Time-Soft-Tissue-Simulation-With-RL-Trained-Policy-for-Laser-Ablation
Realistic physics-based real-time simulation of soft tissue in Unity environment with ablation damage animation. Utilization of ML-Agents to create RL-trained policy that autonomously guides the laser to ablate endometriosis lesion patterns.
